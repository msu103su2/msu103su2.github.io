title: Quantum simulation with Fermi-Hubbard model with LAO/STO
---

Fermi-Hubbard model is a model describing stronggly coupled electrons in 2 dimissions. Due to the nature of fermions (Pauli exclusion principle), the complexity of this model increases exponentiallty with lattice size and impossible for classical computer to simulate (3x3 sites would need a few GB of RAM, and it is not even close to anything). Fermi-Hubbard model is important as it describes systems with strongger coupled electrons, superconductors for example. A successful simulation of the model can potentially answers the question of superconductivity.

In this project we aim to construct Fermi-HUbaard model with 2D array of quantum dots at LAO/STO interface. Several approaches has been investigated to fabricate such device:
1, Depositing Al dots array (~20 nm radius, varying lattice constant) on top of LAO. Region at the interface of LAO/STO and with Al deposited on top of LAO will become conductive and form a quantum dot.
2, Define quantum dot with conductive AFM(Atomic force microscope). Due to the physics property of LAO/STO, conductive region forms when the tip of AFM touches the surface of LAO.
3, Expose LAO/STO sample with SEM (scanning electron microscope). Due to the physics property of LAO/STO, conductive region forms when the electron beam attack the region.
