As a physics PhD candidate at University of Pittsburgh, I have a passion for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of complex systems and applying them to life-changing technologies. My current research focuses on quantum enhanced metrology where we aim to propose and demonstrate new ideas utilizing quantum property to beat 'classic' sensing limit. While the experiments are mostly performed in highly coupled hybrid systems (optical-mechanical, optical-electrical), it also posses potential applications such as quantum memory and quantum repeater for quantum information technology.

I am also currently doing an intern/co-op at Skyworks Solutions, where I collaborate with a team of engineers and scientists on the research and development of BAW devices, where I focuses on the optical and electrical characterization of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators for RF filters, which is used in front-end of mobile devices for wireless communication.
